        <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>My name is Josslin Banza Lenge, I was born on the 16 <sup>th</sup> of october 2000. I was born in <abbr title="Democratic Republique of Congo">Dr congo</abbr>, and I landed in canada as a <em>11 years old</em> kid, with my familly. It was challenging to arrive in a new country, but you got to keep your head up and prosper in hard times, and also since I was quite young, it was probably easier for me than my older siblings.

      Fast forward to my life now, I am 25 years old. A lot of time as passed since I arrived in this country, winter is still so hard to get used to. But other things are easier to get used to, but life is always changing, you never know what other lessons you will learn.
